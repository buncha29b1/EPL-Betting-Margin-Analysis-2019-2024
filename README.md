## 🔍 Overview
Bookmakers build a margin (“**overround**”) into match odds so the implied probabilities sum to a value larger than **100%**, guaranteeing profit regardless of outcome.  
This project analyzes **five EPL seasons (2019–20 → 2023–24)** to understand:

- Do margins differ by **match result** (home/draw/away)?
- Are margins higher when the **home team is favored**?
- Have margins **changed over time**?
- How much of the margin can be explained by the **odds structure** itself?
